The UMass Nutrition app is a project Aidan Campbell and I worked on for HackUMass 7. 

## Intro

The UMass Nutrition app spawned out of the idea to make tracking nutrition easier for students. Currently, if you want to track calories and other macronutrients you'd have to open up the UMass Dining app, click on the food, and then manually enter the information into a calore-tracking app. We posed a solution to this problem, which would be the UMass Nutrition app.

## Development

Our ambitious goal of creating a single app within 36 hours was realized to be a bit unrealistic seeing that neither of us had ever done Android development. Another long setback was the fact that the UMass Dining website showed all food items together, and in the code they never really differentiated between what was a lunch item and what was a dinner item. This made it difficult to even figure out what was the correct tag to extract from the website.

## Aftermath

There was a lot learned within this small but ambitious project, namely time management skills, having realistic expectations, along with more technical aspects such as python skills and getting familiar with Android development. We hope to continue to develop this side project and make it a useful tool for students and the Nutrition department.
